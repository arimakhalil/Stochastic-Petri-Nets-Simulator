# Stochastic Petri Nets Simulator
Stochastic Petri Nets Simulator is a normal petri nets simulator which has probabilistic transitions.
Where the transition fire rate is exponentially distributed.
For the concurrent transition, the one with the less time delay will fire according to petri net logic.
If the simulator needs to conduct like normal petri nets, then
the transition probability must assign to zero.
